Synopsis:            Haskell Equational Reasoning Model-to-Implementation Tunnel
Description:	     HERMIT uses Haskell to express semi-formal models,
		     efficient implementations, and provide a bridging DSL
		     to describe via stepwise refinement the connection between
		     these models and implementations. The key transformation
		     in the bridging DSL is the worker/wrapper transformation.
